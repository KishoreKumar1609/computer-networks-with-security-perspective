# Introduction to Computer Networks

## 1. What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a connection between two or more devices that allows them to share data and resources.
Communication between devices can occur through different transmission media such as:
- Electrical cables (wired)
- Optical fiber (light signals)
- Wireless communication (radio waves)

## 2. How Do Computers Share Data? 
A device connects to a network using a hardware component called a **Network Interface Card (NIC)**.
The NIC enables a device to send and receive data over a network and operates using different communication media.
Each NIC contains a unique physical identifier known as a MAC address.

## 3. What is a MAC Address?
A **MAC (Media Access Control) Address** is a unique physical address assigned to a network interface.
It is similar to a vehicle chassis number and helps identify devices within a local network.

## 4. What is a Logical Address?
A logical address refers to the **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**.
It enables communication across different networks and allows devices to be identified globally over the Internet.

## 5. Network Devices
### RepeaterA repeater strengthens weakened signals during long-distance transmission to maintain signal quality.
### Hub
A hub connects multiple devices and broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices. It is a non-intelligent device and inefficient compared to modern devices.
### Bridge
A bridge connects multiple network segments and forwards data using MAC addresses.
### Switch
A switch intelligently forwards data only to the intended device, improving efficiency and performance.
### Router
A router connects different networks and forwards packets using IP addresses and routing tables.
### Gateway
A gateway connects networks that use different communication protocols.

## 6. Network Topology
Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network.
### Bus Topology
All devices share a single backbone cable. Failure of the backbone stops communication.
### Star Topology
All devices connect to a central hub or switch. Failure of the central device disrupts the network.
### Ring Topology
Each device connects to two neighboring devices forming a circular path for data transmission.
### Mesh Topology
Every device connects to multiple devices, providing high reliability and fault tolerance.

## 7. Types of Networks
### PAN (Personal Area Network)
Short-range networks such as Bluetooth connections.
### LAN (Local Area Network)
Used within buildings or organizations.
### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
Covers large areas such as cities.
### WAN (Wide Area Network)
Connects networks across countries and continents, forming the Internet.
